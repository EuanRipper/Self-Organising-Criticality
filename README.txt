Right click to add sand fast, left click to add grains at a time!
this is a birds eye view of a sand pit!
all properties of gravity and friction are modelled by a simple rule. If a single cell has more than 4 grains of sand it topples, returning to 0 and the sand is moved to neighbouring cells.
some crazy nice patterns can emerge!
this is not a new idea. Its called an Abelian Sand pile and is a part of maths i find super interesting.
try adding a huge pile on one pixel. you'll see some amazing patterns emerge.
note how adding just a few grains randomly will break this symmetry and create chaos
see how toppling a pile can have a ripple effect
